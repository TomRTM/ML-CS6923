Machine Learning Final Project How to detect twitter bots(robots, or automated accounts)

Twitter is a popular online social networking tool, which was released in 2006. Users talk to each other by pulishing short text posts. The popularity and convienient of Twitter brings a huge number of users and also some bots used to pulish advertisements and leave comments under otherâ€™s posts. Some bots are there to help delivering news and update feedback others are spreading spam. We are here to help people iditify which account is bot and which is not. We first collect more than 2000 accounts ( by the whole class). We identify them as bot or not bot by ourself accourding to the behavior of the account such as tweet conten, account profile, followers count, favorite count and etc. . Some of the accounts are bought from the internet which is absolutely bots. Based on the result we use what we learn from the class we use Navie Bayes and Decision Tree to classify the accounts.
